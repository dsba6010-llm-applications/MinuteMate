During the Public Hearing, Nicole Matthews spoke to thank the board for their response to her email and acknowledged receiving a letter detailing the steps being taken. Following the presentation and public comment, a motion to close the Public Hearing was made by Mayor Pro Tempore Atkinson and seconded by Commissioner Abernathy, with a unanimous vote of 5 to 0.
