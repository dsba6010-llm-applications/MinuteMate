Assistant Town Manager Josh Watkins presented the proposed ordinance, which regulates mobile food vendors on private property, allowing their operation on a limited basis in nonresidential districts. The standards outlined include regulations for hours of operation, distance from fire hydrants, and proximity to streams like the South Fork River to prevent spills and trash pollution. During the Public Hearing, Nicole Matthews expressed gratitude for the board's response to her email and acknowledged receiving a letter explaining the steps being taken. Following the presentation and public comment, a motion to close the Public Hearing was made by Mayor Pro Tempore Atkinson, seconded by Commissioner Abernathy, and passed unanimously with a vote of 5-0.

        "retrieval_context": "Assistant Town Manager Josh Watkins presented the proposed text amendment, highlighting that while the current Town Code of Ordinances regulates food trucks on street rights of way and town-owned land, there are no regulations for food trucks operating on private property. The proposed ordinance aims to allow mobile food vendors to operate on a limited basis in nonresidential districts, with additional standards to address hours of operation, distance from fire hydrants, and proximity to streams like the South Fork River to prevent spills or trash from polluting waterways. During the Public Hearing, Nicole Matthews spoke to thank the board for their response to her email and acknowledged receiving a letter detailing the steps being taken. Following the presentation and public comment, a motion to close the Public Hearing was made by Mayor Pro Tempore Atkinson and seconded by Commissioner Abernathy, with a unanimous vote of 5 to 0.
