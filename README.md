### üìÑ Overview

MinuteMate improves how municipalities communicate with their citizens by simplifying the creation of meeting minutes. Upload your meeting audio and get formatted, ready-to-use minutes in less time. This ensures faster, clearer communication between local governments and their communities, providing key points, agenda items, and voting outcomes quickly and efficiently.

### System Design Target

### Components

- [**MinuteMate-Verba**](Verba/) - **Temporary** core of the app, based on Weaviate's [Verba](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba).  This includes the front end and back end (or integrations) for the RAG document management and pre-processing pipeline and as well as the chat interface.  At minimum, it relies on external integrations for the vector embedding model, for the prompting/chat model, and for the vector database.

- [**MinuteMate App**](MinuteMate/) - The public-facing chat application (in development).  This requires integration with the vector database, an embedding model (must match one of the embedding models used for preprocessing), and at least one generation model. Other possible integrations include a RAG-reranking model.  

- [**Preprocessing Pipeline**](Preprocessing/) - A set of tools to tranform raw audio and text files into vector-indexed chunks.  At minimum, it requires integration with an audio transcription model (currently AssemblyAI), an embedding model, and the vector database (currently Weaviate) which will serve as the repository. Other possible integrations include a generative model to be used to assist with data cleaning.

- [**Llama on Modal**](/Llama_On_Modal/) - Deploys [Llama](https://www.llama.com/) models to be served by [Modal](https://modal.com/).

- [**Dev Notebooks**](dev_notebooks/) - This includes various notebooks for developing or testing components of the preprocessing pipeline and application.
