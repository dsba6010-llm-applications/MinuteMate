# # Run an OpenAI-Compatible vLLM Server
#
# LLMs do more than just model language: they chat, they produce JSON and XML, they run code, and more.
# OpenAI's API has emerged as a standard interface for LLMs,
# and it is supported by open source LLM serving frameworks like vLLM.
#
# In this example, we show how to run a vLLM server in OpenAI-compatible mode on Modal.
# Note that the vLLM server is a FastAPI app, which can be configured and extended just like any other.
# Here, we use it to add simple authentication middleware, following the
# [implementation in the vLLM repository](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/blob/v0.4.1/vllm/entrypoints/openai/api_server.py).
#
# ## Set up the container image
#
# Our first order of business is to define the environment our server will run in: the [container `Image`](https://modal.com/docs/guide/custom-container).
# We'll build it up, step-by-step, from a slim Debian Linux image.
#
# First, we install some dependencies with `pip`.

vllm_image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.10").pip_install(
    [
        "vllm==0.4.1",  # LLM serving
        "huggingface_hub==0.22.2",  # download models from the Hugging Face Hub
        "hf-transfer==0.1.6",  # download models faster
    ]
)

# Then, we need to get hold of the weights for the model we're serving:
# Meta's LLaMA 3-8B Instruct. We create a Python function for this and add it to the image definition,
# so that we only need to download it when we define the image, not every time we run the server.
#
# If you adapt this example to run another model,
# note that for this step to work on a [gated model](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/models-gated)
# the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable must be set and provided as a [Modal Secret](https://modal.com/secrets).

# ## Build the server
#
# vLLM's OpenAI-compatible server is a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) app.
#
# FastAPI is a Python web framework that implements the [ASGI standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_Server_Gateway_Interface),
# much like [Flask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flask_(web_framework)) is a Python web framework
# that implements the [WSGI standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface).
#
# Modal offers [first-class support for ASGI (and WSGI) apps](https://modal.com/docs/guide/webhooks). We just need to decorate a function that returns the app
# with `@modal.asgi_app()` (or `@modal.wsgi_app()`) and then add it to the Modal app with the `app.function` decorator.
#
# The function below first imports the FastAPI app from the vLLM library, then adds some middleware. You might also add more routes here.
#
# Then, the function creates an `AsyncLLMEngine`, the core of the vLLM server. It's responsible for loading the model, running inference, and serving responses.
#
# After attaching that engine to the FastAPI app via the `api_server` module of the vLLM library, we return the FastAPI app
# so it can be served on Modal.

# ## Deploy the server
#
# To deploy the API on Modal, just run
# ```bash
# modal deploy api.py
# ```
#
# This will create a new app on Modal, build the container image for it, and deploy.
#
# ### Interact with the server
#
# Once it is deployed, you'll see a URL appear in the command line,
# something like `https://your-workspace-name--vllm-openai-compatible-serve.modal.run`.
#
# You can find [interactive Swagger UI docs](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
# at the `/docs` route of that URL, i.e. `https://your-workspace-name--vllm-openai-compatible-serve.modal.run/docs`.
# These docs describe each route and indicate the expected input and output.
#
# For simple routes like `/health`, which checks whether the server is responding,
# you can even send a request directly from the docs.
#
# To interact with the API programmatically, you can use the Python `openai` library.
#
# See the small test `client.py` script included with this example for details.
#
# ```bash
# # pip install openai==1.13.3
# python client.py
# ```
