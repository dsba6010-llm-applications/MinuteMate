            "[06:42.660 --> 06:52.660]  So basically, just like talk about with the trails all friends lead to Kramer 10 same thing with bikes all.\n",
            "[06:53.660 --> 06:58.660]  Bike roads by simplest friendly roads will lead to downtown Kramer 10.\n",

            "[07:25.660 --> 07:30.660]  And since we just, you know, let's, let's complete this.\n",
            "[07:30.660 --> 07:38.660]  We're not talking big capital expenses, and we're talking more recreation, but, you know, as part of the fabric of who we are.\n",

            "[07:43.660 --> 07:53.660]  So we need more street sign markers and the paintings, the share roads on the streets themselves.\n",
            "[07:53.660 --> 08:05.660]  Next slide is an image from Belmont, which we ended signage on the roads on the telephone poles.\n",
            "[08:05.660 --> 08:17.660]  Share the roads and, you know, basically where some of the past are just way finding signs for bicyclists.\n",
            "[08:17.660 --> 08:23.660]  Whether son from Belmont, they, they're pretty good job. They, they have roads with the lanes on the right hand side.\n",
            "[08:23.660 --> 08:33.660]  We can't do that everywhere. We have some of those opportunities, but primarily it'll be on the roads themselves.\n",
            "[08:33.660 --> 08:40.660]  Bike stations to stop, change your bike up and park it.\n",
            "[08:40.660 --> 08:47.660]  Yep. Go and enjoy. Go enjoy the parks, do some hiking.\n",
            "[08:47.660 --> 08:56.660]  Just a few of these at different places around downtown or through out towns.\n",
            "[08:57.660 --> 09:06.660]  Put on a project while back the ability to have a bicycle race in Kramerton, which is very much a possibility for us.\n",
            "[09:06.660 --> 09:15.660]  We could partner with folks like self main cycle over Belmont and some of the different guests and has a bicycle club.\n",
            "[09:15.660 --> 09:26.660]  Charlotte has a number of them, but really promote Kramerton as a bicycle friendly town and bring road race here.\n",
            "[09:26.660 --> 09:34.660]  Build that around one of the existing festivals, one of the events we're already doing.\n",
            "[09:34.660 --> 09:44.660]  And then again, just a recap, just become the most bicycle friendly spot in the Charlotte Metro area, fitness connectivity, recreation.\n",
            "[09:44.660 --> 09:54.660]  It's all pluses. I don't personally, I don't see many negatives to do it. There's not a big cause to make these changes to our roads.\n",
            "[09:54.660 --> 10:03.660]  A little bit of coordination with DOT and add some signs and we should be pretty much on our way.\n",
            "[10:03.660 --> 10:16.660]  Is Lakewood Road wide enough to have a bike lane only sign? I mean, without restricting yourself.\n",
            "[10:16.660 --> 10:25.660]  I don't think so. So from the bridge towards Wilkinson, I don't believe so that you'd have to walk the roads.\n",
            "[10:25.660 --> 10:33.660]  Commissioner, if you look in Belmont, you're looking right down Belmont where somebody's picture is taken. That's a very narrow road.\n",
            "[10:33.660 --> 10:43.660]  But yet they put the path on each side, they put share of the road and also so it slows down the traffic going all the way through there.\n",
            "[10:43.660 --> 10:48.660]  And also for the kids to bicycle to school.\n",
            "[10:48.660 --> 10:52.660]  Well, that's why that's in Lakewood.\n",
            "[10:52.660 --> 10:54.660]  Thanks.\n",
            "[10:54.660 --> 10:58.660]  Any other questions, comments?\n",
            "[10:58.660 --> 11:04.660]  I think there's a great opportunity to partner with some folks. I think you had them both in your area.\n",
            "[11:04.660 --> 11:14.660]  I know the last year I've mentioned it before, there was a, it wasn't technically a road race so much as a little scavenger hunt and branded you may know more than I do on it.\n",
            "[11:14.660 --> 11:33.660]  But they had a, almost like a relay type race here in Cramerton with Katoa River Keeper where they went in different historic, found different historic markedly with different boat ramps or whatever throughout Cramerton with an excellent showcase of Cramerton.\n",
            "[11:33.660 --> 11:40.660]  Unfortunately, it was after a heavy rain and the river was moving pretty good so they weren't able to do the kayak inclusion.\n",
            "[11:40.660 --> 11:48.660]  But I think if my memory serves me correctly, there had to have been at least 200 bicycles out here in the town center.\n",
            "[11:48.660 --> 11:56.660]  So we're known for bicycles. I'm in favor of getting this started, parking the roads and putting the songs up.\n",
            "[11:56.660 --> 11:58.660]  I appreciate that.\n",
            "[11:58.660 --> 12:06.660]  One of the other things you mentioned, we can have little kids races all around the, going around the,\n",
            "[12:06.660 --> 12:16.660]  Yeah, not going around. I'm just thinking about going several laps around the, where are we going? Right out here.\n",
            "[12:16.660 --> 12:17.660]  Center street downtown.\n",
            "[12:17.660 --> 12:25.660]  Center street around center street and age down there. You can have kids races, you know, a couple laps around three races and have different age groups.\n",
            "[12:25.660 --> 12:29.660]  And if I could make a couple of comments down there.\n",
            "[12:29.660 --> 12:38.660]  So, you know, Cramerton is well positioned to be the recreational capital of not only Gaston County, but the region.\n",
            "[12:38.660 --> 12:44.660]  We have plighting on the trade trails. We have kayaking on the Southport River. We have floating on the Southport River.\n",
            "[12:44.660 --> 12:50.660]  We have canoeing on the Southport River. We have fishing beers off into the Southport River.\n",
            "[12:50.660 --> 12:56.660]  We have one of the most dynamic playgrounds on God Island.\n",
            "[12:56.660 --> 13:04.660]  And so we just want to add one thing is this real connectivity of all these bicycle paths. It'll bring more business to town.\n",
            "[13:04.660 --> 13:12.660]  Kids are safer, even to bike to school, as I mentioned, Richard, and connectivity to Belmont trails.\n",
            "[13:12.660 --> 13:17.660]  We just tie in the Belmont trails because there's trails going down into\n",
            "[13:17.660 --> 13:21.660]  as you go off Rocky Branch.\n",
            "[13:21.660 --> 13:28.660]  Rocky Branch. We've got those trails there, but we just kind of, all we have to do is try to tie all these pieces together.\n",
            "[13:28.660 --> 13:37.660]  And we got, so we can bike the food line. We can bike to the, we can have a tour to Cramerton race and convert to McHadenville.\n",
            "[13:37.660 --> 13:45.660]  Eventually, as we go through there and all the paths that go through there, and if you said connectivity to Eagle Road and all that area.\n",
            "[13:45.660 --> 13:53.660]  So, like I said, it won't be too much. And also electric bikes are coming on strong guys. You're seeing more and more electric bikes.\n",
            "[13:53.660 --> 13:59.660]  So let's be ahead of the curve and bring all this all together. So appreciate you guys.\n",
            "[13:59.660 --> 14:01.660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[14:01.660 --> 14:08.660]  Thank you.\n",
            "[14:08.660 --> 14:15.660]  And so from that standpoint, this is something just getting that DOT on.\n",
            "[14:15.660 --> 14:26.660]  Yeah, and we do have a bike master plan that we can kind of break out and follow through those protocols. Some of this stuff's already kind of on our list of things to do.\n",
            "[14:26.660 --> 14:29.660]  So we just coordinate with DOT's best plan.\n",
            "[14:29.660 --> 14:35.660]  You can make Eastwood bike lane with a pedestrian lane.\n",
            "[14:35.660 --> 14:41.660]  Yeah, preserve. Yeah, that's part of the limit.\n",
            "[14:41.660 --> 14:44.660]  Where'd you say?\n",
            "[14:44.660 --> 14:53.660]  I'd say Eastwood has a temporary barriers for pedestrians. You can advertise that as a bike lane also.\n",
            "[14:53.660 --> 14:59.660]  Okay. Oh, when you go off to your right off of Eagle Road, yeah, that's what I was trying to think of.\n",
            "[14:59.660 --> 15:04.660]  Yeah. And there's just no connectivity. We just tie into that one.\n",
            "[15:04.660 --> 15:09.660]  All right. Everybody good? Good. Good. All right, let's make that happen.\n",
            "[15:09.660 --> 15:11.660]  Right. Mr. Ellis.\n",
            "[15:11.660 --> 15:15.660]  Just to take a quick minute real fast, ma'am.\n",
            "[15:15.660 --> 15:23.660]  If you'd like to come up and talk to our board of commissioners real fast and we can put you guys on the spot.\n",
            "[15:23.660 --> 15:25.660]  It's just hard.\n",

            "[15:49.660 --> 15:58.660]  This has given me the opportunity to travel with my troop to place this like the way in Georgia.\n",
            "[15:58.660 --> 16:06.660]  We have also done various activities from paddle boarding to the aquarium and more.\n",
            "[16:06.660 --> 16:13.660]  Our biggest passion is being able to get back to the community because that could be sad.\n",

            "[25:58.660 --> 26:00.660]  The wellness side is incredible.\n",
            "[26:00.660 --> 26:01.660]  Okay.\n",

            "[26:11.660 --> 26:15.660]  It's a phenomenon going on in this country with officers.\n",
            "[26:15.660 --> 26:21.660]  But it also has embedded information, videos,\n",
            "[26:21.660 --> 26:24.660]  but also on the other side of the app.\n",

            "[26:41.660 --> 26:46.660]  So just going to reiterate what they're proposing is we would create an app.\n",
            "[26:46.660 --> 26:48.660]  The app has two sides to it.\n",
            "[26:48.660 --> 26:52.660]  The citizen can download the app and it's got all the stuff from our,\n",
            "[26:52.660 --> 26:53.660]  uh, website.\n",
            "[26:53.660 --> 26:56.660]  We can adjust the calendars on the fly.\n",
            "[26:56.660 --> 26:57.660]  But most importantly,\n",
            "[26:57.660 --> 27:00.660]  we can push out push notifications to their phone.\n",
            "[27:00.660 --> 27:01.660]  Something's going on.\n",
            "[27:01.660 --> 27:02.660]  Road shut down.\n",
            "[27:02.660 --> 27:04.660]  We can push it out there.\n",
            "[27:04.660 --> 27:06.660]  And they will get it on their phone.\n",
            "[27:06.660 --> 27:08.660]  Just like you get a text message.\n",
            "[27:08.660 --> 27:11.660]  And then for our side as staff,\n",
            "[27:11.660 --> 27:13.660]  we will have certain people that can adjust it.\n",
            "[27:13.660 --> 27:14.660]  So for instance,\n",
            "[27:14.660 --> 27:17.660]  Missy could create a team of,\n",
            "[27:17.660 --> 27:22.660]  the board of commissioners and instead of having to print off the city vision\n",
            "[27:22.660 --> 27:23.660]  pamphlet,\n",
            "[27:23.660 --> 27:25.660]  she could send it straight to you.\n",
            "[27:25.660 --> 27:27.660]  Or if she wanted to push out,\n",
            "[27:27.660 --> 27:31.660]  we need everyone from staff and the council meeting chambers this day for\n",
            "[27:31.660 --> 27:32.660]  some healthcare stuff.\n",
            "[27:32.660 --> 27:34.660]  She pushed it out that way.\n",
            "[27:34.660 --> 27:38.660]  It also works for the police department to be able to load a ton of blank\n",
            "[27:38.660 --> 27:40.660]  hours for when we do the Christmas lights.\n",
            "[27:40.660 --> 27:41.660]  And those people can do that.\n",
            "[27:41.660 --> 27:42.660]  And they can do that.\n",
            "[27:42.660 --> 27:46.660]  So if you want to load a ton of blank hours for when we do the Christmas\n",
            "[27:46.660 --> 27:50.660]  lights and those people can log in and say I want that hour,\n",
            "[27:50.660 --> 27:51.660]  click it.\n",
            "[27:51.660 --> 27:53.660]  All of a sudden they've signed up.\n",
            "[27:53.660 --> 27:56.660]  Our police chief doesn't have to change people down.\n",
            "[27:56.660 --> 27:58.660]  You can also sort stuff on it.\n",
            "[27:58.660 --> 27:59.660]  It's just there's a lot to it.\n",
            "[27:59.660 --> 28:03.660]  And I think it's one of those things that if we get it,\n",
            "[28:03.660 --> 28:07.660]  we'll learn more and more about the capabilities of what it can do.\n",
            "[28:07.660 --> 28:08.660]  Yeah.\n",
            "[28:08.660 --> 28:09.660]  Not only that,\n",
            "[28:09.660 --> 28:14.660]  but we also have some citizens where they can download the picture and or\n",

            "[28:25.660 --> 28:29.660]  And also it has zone checks down the bottom and same on the public side\n",
            "[28:29.660 --> 28:30.660]  of it.\n",
            "[28:30.660 --> 28:32.660]  The zone check can be a vacation request.\n",
            "[28:32.660 --> 28:36.660]  Let's say a citizen goes out of town or you're having a burglary problem\n",

            "[28:38.660 --> 28:41.660]  That goes through the application to the administrator.\n",
            "[28:41.660 --> 28:44.660]  They can assign it to the police department to an individual,\n",
            "[28:44.660 --> 28:48.660]  whoever the check up on that resident or our business.\n",
            "[28:48.660 --> 28:52.660]  It has a lot of different capabilities.\n",

            "[48:58.660 --> 49:00.660]  So essentially.\n",
            "[49:00.660 --> 49:03.660]  You're looking at stormwater control measure.\n",
            "[49:03.660 --> 49:04.660]  A big problem.\n",

            "[49:09.660 --> 49:10.660]  A big pond.\n",
            "[49:10.660 --> 49:13.660]  So essentially we are upping our standard.\n",

            "[49:15.660 --> 49:18.660]  A rain that happens once every 10 years.\n",

            "[49:23.660 --> 49:27.660]  So it's decreasing the flow of water, which helps us a ton.\n",
            "[49:27.660 --> 49:30.660]  As we know.\n",
            "[49:30.660 --> 49:33.660]  We also added 25 year and.\n",
            "[49:33.660 --> 49:36.660]  Which is essentially bigger than the 10 year.\n",
            "[49:36.660 --> 49:39.660]  So those are kind of the huge main points.\n",
            "[49:39.660 --> 49:42.660]  Really like sticky points.\n",
            "[49:42.660 --> 49:45.660]  We've worked at in our local agreement with the county.\n",
            "[49:45.660 --> 49:48.660]  So that'll be going through their engineers.\n",
            "[49:48.660 --> 49:52.660]  And we'll also be forcing that as well.\n",
            "[49:52.660 --> 49:54.660]  What is it now.\n",
            "[49:54.660 --> 49:57.660]  The 10 and 25 years.\n",
            "[49:57.660 --> 49:58.660]  Nothing.\n",
            "[49:58.660 --> 50:02.660]  There's there's currently we adopted the county ordinance.\n",
            "[50:02.660 --> 50:05.660]  And the county ordinance does not have a detention requirement.\n",
            "[50:05.660 --> 50:08.660]  It just requires that you treat the first inch.\n",
            "[50:08.660 --> 50:09.660]  Yep.\n",
            "[50:09.660 --> 50:12.660]  So they don't have a detention requirement whatsoever.\n",
            "[50:12.660 --> 50:14.660]  Well North Carolina state.\n",
            "[50:14.660 --> 50:15.660]  Right.\n",
            "[50:15.660 --> 50:16.660]  If you just tell me.\n",
            "[50:16.660 --> 50:18.660]  You just have to treat that first inch.\n",
            "[50:18.660 --> 50:19.660]  Right.\n",
            "[50:19.660 --> 50:22.660]  So you just have to treat the first inch of rain after that.\n",
            "[50:22.660 --> 50:23.660]  It doesn't really have to contain anything.\n",
            "[50:23.660 --> 50:25.660]  So we're adding the tension.\n",
            "[50:25.660 --> 50:26.660]  So that.\n",
            "[50:26.660 --> 50:29.660]  These are developments that were being trapped and released slowly.\n",
            "[50:29.660 --> 50:32.660]  So it's not all getting the river at the same time and contributing to the problem.\n",
            "[50:32.660 --> 50:34.660]  And so we've got.\n",
            "[50:34.660 --> 50:37.660]  What we're proposing is townwide is the 10 year storm.\n",
            "[50:37.660 --> 50:40.660]  But if you're within the 1000 feet of the South Fork River,\n",
            "[50:40.660 --> 50:43.660]  you do an even higher standard of 25 year storm.\n",
            "[50:43.660 --> 50:46.660]  So that should contain either more water and let it out slowly.\n",
            "[50:46.660 --> 50:47.660]  Yeah.\n",
            "[50:47.660 --> 50:50.660]  Right now because of the fact that we adopted the county ordinance,\n",
            "[50:50.660 --> 50:52.660]  there's was the bare minimum of treat the first inch.\n",
            "[50:52.660 --> 50:55.660]  And we don't really worry about the rest.\n",
            "[50:55.660 --> 51:01.660]  Is this affecting BCM Red Hawk and some of those developments that are already underway?\n",
            "[51:01.660 --> 51:05.660]  It will affect phases that have not had their construction plans approved yet.\n",
            "[51:05.660 --> 51:07.660]  So phase one of Red Hawk.\n",
            "[51:07.660 --> 51:08.660]  No.\n",
            "[51:08.660 --> 51:10.660]  Phase two, phase three potentially.\n",
            "[51:10.660 --> 51:12.660]  Phase two potentially in phase three.\n",
            "[51:12.660 --> 51:13.660]  Absolutely.\n",
            "[51:13.660 --> 51:18.660]  But they, I will say that they did agree to higher standards as far as their conditional\n",
            "[51:18.660 --> 51:19.660]  going.\n",
            "[51:19.660 --> 51:21.660]  So this wouldn't really affect what they're doing anyway.\n",
            "[51:21.660 --> 51:25.660]  But either BCM, any additional phases that they've not done that conditionally.\n",
            "[51:25.660 --> 51:26.660]  Yes.\n",
            "[51:26.660 --> 51:27.660]  Okay.\n",
            "[51:27.660 --> 51:28.660]  I mean, this improved.\n",
            "[51:28.660 --> 51:30.660]  Raised bar across board.\n",
            "[51:30.660 --> 51:33.660]  I mean, it's only, it's only this time.\n",
            "[51:33.660 --> 51:35.660]  Yeah.\n",
            "[51:35.660 --> 51:36.660]  Yeah.\n",

            "[51:50.660 --> 51:53.660]  For the record, I'm over on the top of my agenda.\n",
            "[51:53.660 --> 51:56.660]  I'll talk about it.\n",
            "[51:56.660 --> 51:58.660]  I did like it.\n",
            "[51:58.660 --> 52:01.660]  Yes, sir.\n",
            "[52:01.660 --> 52:07.660]  I want to report a couple of things from the MPL meeting in January 20th.\n",

            "[52:09.660 --> 52:16.660]  And there's a couple of things that, that affect us here.\n",
            "[52:16.660 --> 52:22.660]  One is that we approved an amendment for the tips.\n",
            "[52:22.660 --> 52:29.660]  And basically the short version of that is everything's pushed back a year.\n",
            "[52:29.660 --> 52:35.660]  They were going to let South Fork River bridge this spring.\n",
            "[52:35.660 --> 52:38.660]  And that's going to be next spring.\n",
            "[52:38.660 --> 52:44.660]  The, you look public.\n",
            "[52:45.660 --> 52:47.660]  I was just trying to do some.\n",
            "[52:47.660 --> 52:49.660]  In my head.\n",
            "[52:49.660 --> 52:53.660]  So, and then the, the.\n",
            "[52:53.660 --> 52:59.660]  Tom crossing was also going to be let this, this spring and that's moved to.\n",

            "[53:01.660 --> 53:02.660]  Yes.\n",
            "[53:02.660 --> 53:04.660]  Not up crossing.\n",
            "[53:04.660 --> 53:07.660]  It's 74 Wilkinson bridge.\n",
            "[53:07.660 --> 53:09.660]  Yeah, there's two.\n",

            "[53:25.660 --> 53:27.660]  No February.\n",
            "[53:27.660 --> 53:30.660]  And it was going to be this spring.\n",
            "[53:30.660 --> 53:33.660]  So the Katawa crossing was going to be.\n",
            "[53:33.660 --> 53:35.660]  It's pushed back a year also.\n",
            "[53:35.660 --> 53:39.660]  And the earliest that we can expect that to let.\n",
            "[53:39.660 --> 53:44.660]  It's, as I understand it, is April.\n",
            "[53:44.660 --> 53:47.660]  Of 25.\n",
            "[53:47.660 --> 53:52.660]  So that affects all our river league projects and.\n",
            "[53:52.660 --> 53:53.660]  Whatever.\n",
            "[53:53.660 --> 53:58.660]  And that's not say they won't get pushed again, but that, you know.\n",
            "[53:58.660 --> 54:02.660]  It was interesting question. We had to, we had to prove this amendment.\n",
            "[54:02.660 --> 54:06.660]  And I want to ask what we don't approve this amendment.\n",

            "[55:00.660 --> 55:02.660]  It's crazy.\n",
            "[55:02.660 --> 55:05.660]  So there's a DOT guy.\n",
            "[55:05.660 --> 55:10.660]  That was familiar with it and he said he's the same guy that did the.\n",
