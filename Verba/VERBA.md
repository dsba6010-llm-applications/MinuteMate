# Getting Started with Verba

You have three deployment options for Verba:

- Install via pip

```
pip install goldenverba
```

- Build from Source

```
git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Verba

pip install -e .
```

- Use Docker for Deployment

**Prerequisites**: If you're not using Docker, ensure that you have `Python >=3.10.0` installed on your system.

```
git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Verba

docker compose --env-file <your-env-file> up -d --build
```

If you're unfamiliar with Python and Virtual Environments, please read the [python tutorial guidelines](./PYTHON_TUTORIAL.md).

# API Keys

You can set all API keys in the Verba frontend, but to make your life easier, we can also prepare a `.env` file in which Verba will automatically look for the keys. Create a `.env` in the same directory you want to start Verba in. You can find an `.env.example` file in the [goldenverba](./goldenverba/.env.example) directory.

> Make sure to only set environment variables you intend to use, environment variables with missing or incorrect values may lead to errors.

Below is a comprehensive list of the API keys and variables you may require:

![API Keys in Verba](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba/blob/2.0.0/img/api_screen.png)

## Weaviate

Verba provides flexibility in connecting to Weaviate instances based on your needs. You have three options:

1. **Local Deployment**: Use Weaviate Embedded which runs locally on your device (except Windows, choose the Docker/Cloud Deployment)
2. **Docker Deployment**: Choose this option when you're running Verba's Dockerfile.
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Use an existing Weaviate instance hosted on WCD to run Verba

**🌩️ Weaviate Cloud Deployment (WCD)**

If you prefer a cloud-based solution, Weaviate Cloud (WCD) offers a scalable, managed environment. Learn how to set up a cloud cluster and get the API keys by following the [Weaviate Cluster Setup Guide](https://weaviate.io/developers/wcs/guides/create-instance).

**🐳 Docker Deployment**
Another local alternative is deploying Weaviate using Docker. For more details, follow the [How to install Verba with Docker](#how-to-install-verba-with-docker) section.

![Deployment in Verba](https://github.com/weaviate/Verba/blob/2.0.0/img/verba_deployment.png)

## Ollama

Verba supports Ollama models. Download and Install Ollama on your device (https://ollama.com/download). Make sure to install your preferred LLM using `ollama run <model>`.

Tested with `llama3`, `llama3:70b` and `mistral`. The bigger models generally perform better, but need more computational power.

> Make sure Ollama Server runs in the background and that you don't ingest documents with different ollama models since their vector dimension can vary that will lead to errors

You can verify that by running the following command

```
ollama run llama3
```

## Unstructured

Verba supports importing documents through Unstructured IO (e.g plain text, .pdf, .csv, and more). To use them you need the `UNSTRUCTURED_API_KEY` and `UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL` environment variable. You can get it from [Unstructured](https://unstructured.io/)

> UNSTRUCTURED_API_URL is set to `https://api.unstructuredapp.io/general/v0/general` by default

## AssemblyAI

Verba supports importing documents through AssemblyAI (audio files or audio from video files). To use them you need the `ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get it from [AssemblyAI](https://assemblyai.com)

## OpenAI

Verba supports OpenAI Models such as Ada, GPT3, and GPT4. To use them, you need to specify the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. You can get it from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)

You can also add a `OPENAI_BASE_URL` to use proxies such as LiteLLM (https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=YOUR-OPENAI_BASE_URL
```

## HuggingFace

If you want to use the HuggingFace Features, make sure to install the correct Verba package. It will install required packages to use the local embedding models.
Please note that on startup, Verba will automatically download and install embedding models when used.

```bash
pip install goldenverba[huggingface]

or

pip install `.[huggingface]`
```

> If you're using Docker, modify the Dockerfile accordingly

## Groq

To use Groq LPUs as generation engine, you need to get an API key from [Groq](https://console.groq.com/keys).

>Although you can provide it in the graphical interface when Verba is up, it is recommended to specify it as `GROQ_API_KEY` environment variable before you launch the application.  
It will allow you to choose the generation model in an up-to-date available models list.

# How to deploy with pip

```

5. (Optional)**Create .env file and add environment variables**

# How to build from Source

1. **Clone the Verba repos**

```
git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Verba.git
```

2. **Initialize a new Python Environment**

```
python3 -m virtualenv venv
```

3. **Install Verba**

```
pip install -e .
```

4. **Launch Verba**

```
verba start
```

> You can specify the --port and --host via flags

5. **Access Verba**

```
Visit localhost:8000
```

# How to install Verba with Docker

Docker is a set of platform-as-a-service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. To get started with deploying Verba using Docker, follow the steps below. If you need more detailed instructions on Docker usage, check out the [Docker Curriculum](https://docker-curriculum.com/).

0. **Clone the Verba repos**
   Ensure you have Git installed on your system. Then, open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the Verba repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/weaviate/Verba.git
```

1. **Set necessary environment variables**
   Make sure to set your required environment variables in the `.env` file. You can read more about how to set them up in the [API Keys Section](#api-keys)

2. **Adjust the docker-compose file**
   You can use the `docker-compose.yml` to add required environment variables under the `verba` service and can also adjust the Weaviate Docker settings to enable Authentification or change other settings of your database instance. You can read more about the Weaviate configuration in our [docker-compose documentation](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/docker-compose)

> Please make sure to only add environment variables that you really need.

2. **Deploy using Docker**
   With Docker installed and the Verba repository cloned, navigate to the directory containing the Docker Compose file in your terminal or command prompt. Run the following command to start the Verba application in detached mode, which allows it to run in the background:

```bash

docker compose up -d

```

```bash

docker compose --env-file goldenverba/.env up -d --build

```

This command will download the necessary Docker images, create containers, and start Verba.
Remember, Docker must be installed on your system to use this method. For installation instructions and more details about Docker, visit the official Docker documentation.

4. **Access Verba**

- You can access your local Weaviate instance at `localhost:8080`

- You can access the Verba frontend at `localhost:8000`

If you want your Docker Instance to install a specific version of Verba you can edit the `Dockerfile` and change the installation line.

```
RUN pip install -e '.'
```

## Verba Walkthrough

### Select your Deployment

The first screen you'll see is the deployment screen. Here you can select between `Local`, `Docker`, `Weaviate Cloud`, or `Custom` deployment. The `Local` deployment is using Weaviate Embedded under the hood, which initializes a Weaviate instance behind the scenes. The `Docker` deployment is using a separate Weaviate instance that is running inside the same Docker network. The `Weaviate Cloud` deployment is using a Weaviate instance that is hosted on Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS). The `Custom` deployment allows you to specify your own Weaviate instance URL, PORT, and API key.

### Import Your Data

First thing you need to do is to add your data. You can do this by clicking on `Import Data` and selecting either `Add Files`, `Add Directory`, or `Add URL` tab. Here you can add all your files that you want to ingest.
You can then configure every file individually by selecting the file and clicking on `Overview` or `Configure` tab.
